# transactions
A simple web interface that accepts a JSON string of transactions and outputs a summary of the transactions. The JSON string should contain a credit limit and a list of events detailing whether the transaction was authenticated, settled, cleared, paid off, posted or cancelled. The summary contains the available credit, payable balance, pending transactions, and settled transactions following all the events listed.
